# equatio

Equatio should be an interactive learn program. It should give the opportunity to insert different equations and divide them in different parts. In a second step the program will provide a short game, where you have the task to put the equations from different parts new together. 

# Feedback
I could run it, but I don't know how to interact with it. Equation module is very impressive already as well the tests!

I commented and added some "suggestions" on what you might or should change.

Otherwise some other points:
- Have you run ruff and mypy? On equation.py most likely yes, but please do it on the rest as well.
- installation / usage guide is missing (which python can I use?)
- improve on commit messages, you have good one like (https://github.com/equatio-group/equatio/commit/f091715d080a9806ed80486e79c765ba12553b4c) and some too short ones (https://github.com/equatio-group/equatio/commit/d720f54c80b47f9ad355695117c7788ac961f315)
- be careful if you work together and only one person commits, this looks like basically all code is by just one of you!
