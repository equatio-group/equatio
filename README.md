## how to play
Equatio is an interactive learn program.
How to play:
By default you can play with a set of 16 terms from the following equations:
Ideal gas law,
Bernoulli equation,
Gibbs energy for homogenic nucleation,
Adiabatic temperature gradient,
Kinetic energy equation of the mean flow in turbulent system.
For playing just run the main.py script. In a new window the board game will appear. 
Now you see the terms on the boardgame and you can place them with drag and drop in the equation below the cards.
If you think your equation is complete, you can click on the check button and the game will check if your equation is 
correct or not. Have fun playing.
